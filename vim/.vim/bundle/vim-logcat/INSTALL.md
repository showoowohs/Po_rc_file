For the simplest way to get this syntax highlighting installed, copy the
contents of the `ftdetect` and `syntax` directories to `~/.vim/` (on UNIX) or
`%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles` (on Windows) and you're good to go.

If you're using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), or a similar plug-in manager, you
can use the GitHub repository directly.
